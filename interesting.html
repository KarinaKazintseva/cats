                    <p>Cats have been domesticated for around 4,000 years. While they were once valued for their hunting abilities, they are now valued for their companionship and loving behaviour.</p>
                    <p>While not well known, the collective nouns used for cats and kittens are a clowder of cats and a kindle of kittens.</p>
                    <p>Our domestic cats are known as little cats. They differ from large cats such as lions and tigers because they are naturally active at night and can purr.</p>
                    <p>Cats are now the most popular pet in the UK and in the US. </p>
